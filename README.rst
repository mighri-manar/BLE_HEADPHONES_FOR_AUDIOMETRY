This repository contains the core of nRF Connect SDK, including subsystems,
libraries, samples, and applications. This repo will be modified to integrate new features into the nRF5340 Audio application. 
These enhancements are tailored for a diagnostic headphone system that measures ambient noise and generates hearing test signals.
It is also the SDK's west manifest repository, containing the nRF Connect SDK
manifest (west.yml).

ðŸ”¹ About This Fork


This fork builds upon the original nRF5340 Audio application with the following modifications:

âœ… Ambient Noise Measurement â€“ Integrating noise level detection to adapt hearing tests based on the environment.

âœ… Modified Unicast Server & Client â€“ Extending the existing audio streaming features to support diagnostic functionalities.

âœ… Codec Integration â€“ Exploring support for an SBC codec and a codec with 8 entries + integrated DSP.


ðŸ“Œ Key Modifications


ðŸ“¡ Ambient Noise Detection: Measures surrounding noise levels and transmits a signal indicating noise conditions.

ðŸŽµ Enhanced Audio Processing: Adapts hearing test signals based on ambient noise to improve accuracy.

ðŸ”§ Codec Evaluation & Implementation: Investigating additional codec support for improved audio signal processing.



ðŸš€ Getting Started

          git clone https://github.com/mighri-manar/BLE_HEADPHONES_FOR_AUDIOMETRY.git

          cd BLE_HEADPHONES_FOR_AUDIOMETRY

          west init -l

          west update
