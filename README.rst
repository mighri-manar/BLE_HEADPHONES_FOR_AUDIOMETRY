## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### 1. Zephyr RTOS Deployment

**Thread Configuration:**
- **Stack Size**: 1024 bytes (noise monitoring thread)
- **Scheduling**: Preemptive, priority-based
- **Interrupt Latency**: <10µs (deterministic real-time)

**Task Creation Example:**
```c
k_tid_t noise_tid = k_thread_create(&noise_thread_data,
                                     noise_thread_stack,
                                     NOISE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE,
                                     noise_level_thread,
                                     NULL, NULL, NULL,
                                     NOISE_THREAD_PRIORITY, 0, K_NO_WAIT);
```

### 2. BLE Audio Integration

**Configuration:**
- **Profile**: BAP Unicast (client/server roles)
- **Codec**: LC3 (hardware-accelerated)
- **Connection Interval**: 10ms
- **Latency Target**: <50ms end-to-end

**Roles:**
- **Unicast Client** (Audio Source): Test signal generator
- **Unicast Server** (Audio Sink): Diagnostic headphones

### 3. Ambient Noise Measurement

**Signal Processing Pipeline:**
```
I²S Microphone → RX FIFO Buffer → RMS Calculation → Threshold Detection → LED Control
```

**RMS Formula:**
```
RMS = sqrt(Σ(x_i²) / N)  where N = 64 samples
```

**Implementation:**
```c
// 64-sample RMS calculation
uint64_t square_sum = 0;
for (size_t i = 0; i < NOISE_SAMPLES_PER_READ; i++) {
    square_sum += (int32_t)samples[i] * samples[i];
}
float rms = sqrtf((float)square_sum / NOISE_SAMPLES_PER_READ);

// Threshold-based LED control
if (rms > 400 && !led_on) {
    gpio_pin_set_dt(&rgb2_red, 1);  // Turn on red LED
    led_on = true;
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **64-sample window**: Balance between reactivity and CPU load
- **1-second refresh**: Optimizes power consumption while maintaining responsiveness
- **Non-blocking FIFO access**: Prevents interference with BLE streaming

### 4. Dual-Core Architecture

**Network Core:**
- BLE protocol stack execution
- Radio communication management
- LC3 codec hardware acceleration

**Application Core:**
- Zephyr RTOS application logic
- Audio processing and routing
- Ambient noise monitoring
- User interface control
